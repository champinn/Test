The flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare and beautiful of all.
在逆境中盛开的花是最稀有、最灿烂的花朵。2018-11-07

Crossing miles of frustrations and rivers a raging, pick up stones I found along the way.
穿过满路荆棘挫折，越过无数狂怒激流，我也不忘一路寻找圆润美丽的卵石。2018-11-08

May you live the way you like.
愿你能过上自己喜欢的生活。2018-11-09
